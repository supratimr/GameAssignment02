# Game-Assignment02
Game Challenge Assignment for IOS platform
Created by Supratim Ray

This project is made using Cocos2D library and native objective-c++ without any intention to use it commercially. This is created for a game assignment given to me. The assets are created with MS paint.

It is more of a PoC than a game, as there are more enhancements can be done. The project can have bugs and need fine tuning, optimization and smoothness.

The dificulty of multiple levels can be tweaked through plist file. Every level of the game uses level specific plist file named as "Level[num].plist". Currently it does not save player level progress and in every launch starts from level 1 difficulty.

Any question and suggestion regarding this can be mailed to: ray_supratim@yahoo.com.

Any part or whole of the project can not be used for any commercial or non-commercial purpose without written consent from me. However,solely for academic purpose this project can be refered with written consent.
